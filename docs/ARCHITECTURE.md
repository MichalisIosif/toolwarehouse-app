# Architecture and Design Decisions

## Overview

ToolWarehouse is a mobile application designed for mechanics to purchase tools and equipment. The app is built using React Native with Expo, TypeScript, and Firebase, following modern mobile development practices and architectural patterns.

## Design Principles

### 1. Clean Architecture

The application follows clean architecture principles:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Interface Segregation**: Components expose only necessary interfaces
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one reason to change

### 2. Component-Based Architecture

- **Reusable Components**: UI components are modular and reusable
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Components are composed rather than inherited
- **Props Interface**: Clear TypeScript interfaces for component props
- **State Management**: Context-based state management for global state

### 3. Data Flow

```
User Action → Component → Context → Service → Firebase → UI Update
```

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Context
- **Navigation**: Expo Router
- **UI Components**: Native Base
- **Forms**: React Hook Form
- **Validation**: Zod

### Backend
- **Platform**: Firebase
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Database**: Firestore
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage
- **Functions**: Firebase Cloud Functions
- **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Mobile-First Approach

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Touch-Optimized**: Large touch targets
- **Offline Support**: Works without internet connection
- **Performance**: Optimized for mobile devices

### 2. State Management

We chose React Context over Redux because:
- Simpler learning curve
- Built into React
- Sufficient for our needs
- Easier to maintain

### 3. Firebase Integration

Firebase was chosen because:
- Quick setup
- Real-time capabilities
- Built-in authentication
- Scalable infrastructure
- Cost-effective for small to medium apps

### 4. TypeScript Adoption

Benefits of using TypeScript:
- Type safety
- Better IDE support
- Easier refactoring
- Better documentation
- Catch errors early

## System Architecture

### 1. Authentication Flow

```
User → Login Screen → Firebase Auth → Protected Routes → App Content
```

### 2. Product Management

```
Admin → Product Management → Firestore → Product List → User View
```

### 3. Order Processing

```
User → Cart → Order Creation → Firebase Functions → Order Confirmation
```

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication

- Email/Password authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure session management
- Token validation

### 2. Data Security

- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Firebase Security Rules
- Input validation
- Data sanitization

### 3. API Security

- HTTPS only
- Rate limiting
- Request validation
- Error handling

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Frontend Optimization

## Deployment Strategy

### 1. Development

- Local development
- Testing environment
- Staging environment
- Production environment

### 2. CI/CD

- Automated testing
- Code quality checks
- Build automation
- Deployment automation

## Monitoring and Analytics
